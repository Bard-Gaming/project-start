~project-start~ is a highly configurable command line utility
allowing you to easily start new projects in all kinds of
programming languages, such as C, C++, and Python.

** Installing
This project uses *GNU Make* to build and install all
necessary files.

*** Express install
To install the recommended version of the CLI, all you need
to do is run the following commands:

#+begin_src shell
git clone git@github.com:Bard-Gaming/project-start.git
cd project-start
make install
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
[!TIP]
Once installation is complete, you may run
~make fclean~ to delete the files that were
created during the install process, or you
can simply delete the cloned repository.
#+end_quote

*** Debug install
To install a version of the CLI with debug symbols enabled, you may
prepend the ~install~ rule with ~debug~, as follows:
#+begin_src shell
make debug install
#+end_src

** Using the CLI
To view the CLI's usage and options, you may simply run
#+begin_src shell
project-start --help
#+end_src

Some of the available options are as follows:
| *Option*     | *Description*                                                                         |
| ~--language~ | Choose the project's programming language (default: C)                                |
| ~--git~      | Initializes a git repository when creating the                                        |
| ~--remote~   | Specifies the remote that should be used for the git repository. This implies ~--git~ |

** Customizing
By default, the command's config can be found at
~~/.config/epitech-project-start/~.

The config is structured as follows:
#+begin_src
<config root>/
  |-- templates/
        |-- common/
        |     |-- <file name>.template
        |-- <programming language>/
              |-- <file name>.template
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
[!IMPORTANT]
Only files ending in ~.template~ will get
added to new projects. Directories are not
affected by this.
#+end_quote

*** Templates
Template files (i.e. files ending in ~.template~) can
contain variables in the following format: ~{{VAR_NAME}}~.

These variables will get replaced when a new project is
created.

*** Variables
The variables that are available by default are as follows:

| *Name*             | *Description*                                                                              |
| ~{{name}}~         | Project Name, as specified by the NAME argument                                            |
| ~{{NAME}}~         | The value of ~{{name}}~ in uppercase                                                       |
| ~{{display_name}}~ | Project's Display Name, as specified by the DISPLAY_NAME argument (defaults to ~{{name}}~) |
| ~{{author}}~       | The name of the user running the command                                                   |
| ~{{organisation}}~ | Project's organisation (default: ~EPITECH~)                                                |
