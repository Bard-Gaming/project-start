~project-start~ is a highly configurable command line utility
allowing you to easily start new projects in different
low-level programming languages, such as C and C++.

** Installing
To install the CLI, all you need to do is run the following
commands:

#+begin_src shell
git clone git@github.com:Bard-Gaming/project-start.git
cd project-start
make install
#+end_src

** Using the CLI
To view the CLI's usage and options, you may simply run
#+begin_src shell
project-start --help
#+end_src

Some of the available options are as follows:
| Option           | Description                                                   |
| ~--language~     | Choose the project's programming language (default: C)        |
| ~--organisation~ | Set the 'organisation' variable for templates                 |
| ~--year~         | Set the 'year' variable for templates (default: current year) |

** Customizing
By default, the command's config can be found at
~~/.config/epitech-project-start/~.

The config is structured as follows:
#+begin_src
<config root>/
  |-- templates/
        |-- common/
        |     |-- <file name>.template
        |-- <programming language>/
              |-- <file name>.template
#+end_src

Template files (i.e. files ending in ~.template~) can
contain variables in the following format: ~{{VAR_NAME}}~.

These variables will get replaced when a new project is
created.
